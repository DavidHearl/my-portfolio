                    I'm a full-stack developer with a background in mechanical and electrical engineering, 
                    now focused on crafting smart, reliable software. I like building tools that solve 
                    real problems — whether that’s for the web or my homelab.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="general-text">
                    I started out as an engineer — maintaining factory equipment, designing precision components, 
                    building testing systems, pioneering in-house 3D printing, and scanning cruise ships with lidar.
                </p>
                <p class="general-text">
                    That hands-on experience gave me a love for systems, efficiency, and practical problem-solving. 
                    Now, I bring that mindset into full-stack development — designing Django apps, building tools, 
                    and automating workflows.
                </p>
                <p class="general-text">
                    I run a self-hosted infrastructure stack at home (Proxmox, TrueNAS, UNRAID) and enjoy treating 
                    development like engineering: plan carefully, automate what you can, and build things that last.
                </p>
                <p class="general-text">
                    Whether it’s a quick CLI script or a full dashboard, I focus on making things that are clean, useful,
                    and genuinely solve problems.
